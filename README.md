### Configuration
Configuration is stored in `config.json`. This defines which cells contain the relevant data for parsing:
* Which columns contain lakes (`column`) and where to get their names from (`nameRows`)
* Which row contains the full storage level for each lake (`fullStorageRow`)
* Which row contains the beginning of the historical levels (`firstDataRow`)
* Which column contains the dates (`dateColumn`). This column is also used to determine the extent of the data (i.e. how many rows of data are available).
